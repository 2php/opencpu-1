HTTP POST Output
----------------

Functions, docs and scripts are evaluated using the evaluate package. 
Outputs are stored in temporary project directory containing:

 *  any files written to the working dir during evaluation
 * .Rdata (serialized environment with objects stored by evaluate())
 * .Rhistory (text, extracted from evaluation)
 * .Revaluation (returned by evaluate)
 
See the project api above for how to continue. GET results are cacheable.


Data Processing Units
---------------------

Data processing units are shebang ascii scripts that can be called through the unix pipeline.
OpenCPU identifies shebang scripts by the .dpu file extension.
The POST body is piped to stdin, response body is stdout. Request and response have identical content-type.
DPU arguments are set using standard x-www-form-urlencoded.
When streaming text, client sets content-type: "text/plain". 
When streaming json, client sets content-type: "application/json". 
The DPU R package helps with running R based DPUs, similar to knit() or brew(). 

One way of implementing text dpu's is using brew.
The script itself has to specify somehow which content-type(s) it supports.
We could define some I/O schema, similar to protocol buffer definitions.
If the input and output types are the same type, we could use support map/reduce.

 

 
Apps repository
---------------

Apps are R packages containing R functions (no src), demos, docs, and web pages that interface them.

By default, they are installed from the official opencpu repo using install.apps() 
Apps are installed to a separate library, i.e. ~/R/apps/myapplib/myapp/ and /usr/local/lib/opencpu/apps/myapplib/myapp/
Packages in the official OpenCPU repository contain LIBRARY files that point to user repositories and dependencies.
When apps are installed locally, LIBRARY files are not needed.

Apps and Dependency versioning
---------------------

Due to limited dependency versioning currently in R, the official repositories require you to specify the full lib.
The OpenCPU repository contains for every app, every version: [URL,LIBRARY,SHA]. One version is called 'latest'.
By default dependencies are taken from CRAN, but also github urls can be specified.
On install, create separate library for each packages. E.g. /usr/local/lib/opencpu/apps/myapplib/myapp/.
To be considered for the OpenCPU repository, the full dependency tree should be declared in LIBRARY. 

Reports
-------

* Execution of R functions or scripts results stores the .Revaluation file.
* The GET /report api converts the .Revaluation to a document using latex or pandoc.
* We could do this for knitr as well.

Documents
---------

Both R scripts/functions and tex/md files are special cases of knitr reports.

* POST example.Rmd or example.Rnw creates a new session with a new session which includes output files.
* By default output is generated for several formats. E.g. PDF, html, slidify, etc. 
* HTTP 303 redirects to the default output.  
* POST myfile.tex or myfile.md are simply special cases of myfiles.Rnw and myfile.Rmd. 
* Basic static GET is used to browse output.


Resources
---------

A resource is a container with files, scripts, functions, plots, data, etc.
There are at least 3 types of containers currently supported:

 * package (includes app-packages): R (objects/functions), manuals, files(www, docs, scripts)
 * session: temporary projects. Include R (objects/functions in .Rdata), plots (in .Rplots), files(www, docs, scripts).
 * gist: Either project (if .Rdata or .Rplots are available) or files(www, docs, scripts) only
 
 
Tmp session store
---------

The /tmp sessions hosts temporary projects. Any call to an R script or function results in a new project. 
Automatically generated project id's are only known to the client and should not be indexable.
Each project contains R objects (stored in .Rdata), plots (stored in .Rplots) 
The directory is browsable in order to support HTML output. 
The /R and /graphics subdirectories of a project are smarter interfaces to .Rdata and .Rplots


 
Protocol Buffers
----------------

Protocol buffers define a binary RPC based I/O stream. They are more formally defined than DPUs. 
They use "content-type" : "application/x-protobuf" and have the rpc in the path instead of a file.
We need to map protobuf RPC to R functions somehow.
OpenCPU makes all .proto files available when loading a package.

GET  /library/package/proto
POST /library/package/proto/[pb_package]/[pb_service]/[pb_rpc]




Stateless HTTP APIs
--------------------

Public library (if enabled): all packages available in a regular user session. 
Library preference order: home-apps, home-library, site-apps, site-library.
RApache OpenCPU does not have home libraries, and can be configured to only host apps, not packages.

 /library/datasets/R
 /library/datasets/R/cars
 /library/datasets/R/cars

 * /pub/mypackage/www
 * /pub/mypackage/data
 * /pub/mypackage/doc
 * /pub/mypackage/man
 

Shared apps and scripts (if enabled, and public readable). Username is UNIX login
 * /user/jeroen/library/mypackage/R (interfaces ~/R/library/)
 * /user/jeroen/share/myproject (static host ~/R/share/)
 

Gist files 
 * /gist/username/gist_id/script.R
 * /gist/username/gist_id/document.Rnw
 * /gist/anonymous/gist_id/document.Rnw
 * /gist/gist_id/script.R (shorthand syntax)


Tmp sessions for serialized R objects. Uses smart default for output (png for graphics, summary for objects).  
 * /session/x9b37ca84b/R/object/ascii (workspace)
 * /session/x9b37ca84b/plots/1/png
 * /session/x9b37ca84b/something.csv (static file server outputs) 

 
Authenticated API's:
 * /home/mypackage (list, install or remove apps, packages or projects in home lib)
 

  

Files, scripts and documents
----------------------------
 * GET on scripts/files is simple fileservers. We use redirect where appropriate (avoid proxying)
 * POST on a script is sort of like hashbang, or dblclick. We try to "run" the script, however appropriate.
 * For R scripts and documents, the POST body can be piped to R stdin.

Run Code
--------

Calling /session allows for running code directly. The output is the same as calling anything else.

POST /session/new?code=rnorm(1)  HTTP 307 /session/x846bc834 (run code in new session)
POST /session/x846bc834?code=rnorm(1)  (run code in new session)
POST /session/x846bc834/somefile.tex
GET  /session/main/R/iris (ROOK/RSTUDIO ONLY)


Scripts
-------

A script is a function body without any parameters.
An exception is when the script contains a function main(). 
In that case, after running the scripts, the main() function is called with posted arguments.

GET  /pub/pfadata/scripts/ (static fileserver)
POST /pub/pfadata/scripts/somescript.R (runs script, store in /session)
GET  /gist/3239667/somescript.R (HTTP 301 redirect)
